Welcome to my website! My name is Wei Zhang (yes, this name is so common I know), a statistics lecturer since May 2021 in the [School of Mathematics and Statistics](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/mathematicsstatistics/) at the [University of Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk), Scotland. I obtained my BSc degree in computational mathematics from [Ocean University of China](http://eweb.ouc.edu.cn/) in 2012, and PhD degree in statistics from the [University of Auckland](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/en.html) in 2018. After that I held two postdoctoral fellowships at [Western University](https://www.uwo.ca/stats/index.html) (2017-2019) and the [University of California Berkeley](https://ourenvironment.berkeley.edu/) (2019-2021). 

My research interests are mostly about ecological statistics and computational statistics. However, I am very keen to broaden my set of interests and seek new collaborations. So, please get in touch if you want to chat about any statistical stuff, although I may just know little or nothing about them. Currently, a lot of my work is about statistical (Bayesian or frequentist) methods for analysis of capture-recapture and spatial capture-recapture data. I am not patient enough, so I am particularly interested in fast (maybe approximate) methods for statistical inference. In addition, I am contributing to some R packages including [nimble](https://r-nimble.org/) and [nimbleSCR](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nimbleSCR/index.html).

I am interested in supervising PhD students. If you feel I am potentially a nice supervisor (yes, I am to be honest), please get in touch!
